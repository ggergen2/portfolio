Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Architect Analyst position. I have experience working with data management and dashboard development, and I believe I would be a great fit for the role.

Although I have minimal experience with **Power BI and Access Database** I have experience building dashboards from scratch with Shiny. I am also confident in my ability to quickly adapt and learn new skills. I have extensive experience cleaning and organizing large datasets to make sure they are accurate and useful. I enjoy working with data and figuring out ways to improve processes through better organization and reporting.

In my past role, Iâ€™ve collaborated with different teams to understand their data needs and deliver insights that drive improvements. I also have experience with **SQL, Python, and R**, which have helped me analyze data more effectively and automate tasks.

I would love the chance to talk more about how I can contribute to the team.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best,

Grey Gergen\
